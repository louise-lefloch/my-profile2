		  		<p>
		  			I am currently studying at IESEG school of management in Lille. I choose to do my master in a business school because I want to go abroad. I already had a university experience outside France. It was in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. It was the best experience of my life and I would like to live that kind of experience again! This time I am planning to go in Asia because, as in Russia, they have a very different culture from ours. This will get me out of my comfort zone and I know that I will learn a lot from this experience.

			<h2>The best experience of my life</h2>
		  	<p>
				In 2019 I did a university exchange in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. This was incredible! I was living in a dorm with a lot of other students and this was a lot of fun. Also, Saint-Petersburg is a magnificent city, with a big history. The Tsar Pierre The Great decided to build this city because he didn't like Moscow. By constructing it, he wanted to do of this city the capital of the country. So, he constructed a lot of huge palaces and golden churches. Which make of this city today, an open-air museum.

		 	<h2>Archery</h2>
		  	<p>
				During their childhood, both of my parents were doing archery, as well as my 4 grand-parents. My parents never forced me to try it, but after I tried several sports, I wanted to try archery... and I loved it. I have been practicing this sport for 5 years now. This brings me concentration, calm and accuracy, which are very important quality in the professional life.

		 	<h2>Travelling</h2>
		 	 <p>
		 	 	I love to have my comfort and a little routine, but I think I love even more being on the road, seeing beautiful landscapes, living human experiences with people from different culture. Since I was little, my dad is travelling a lot and he was always coming back home with incredible pictures and souvenirs. Bust most of all with incredible stories. This gave me a purpose, which is to travel and open myself to other cultures.
